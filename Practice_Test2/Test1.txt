Java Programming Aptitude Test:
===============================

Scenario :
--------
	A client has provided us with a file that contains basic information about their current membership, 
	and asked us to convert the file and send it to one of their business partners. The name of the file is 
	"Members.txt" and it's in a fixed-column format. The fields are found to be in the following order and length:
	
		 id (12)    last name(25)    first name(25)    address(30)    city(20)    state(4)    zip(5) 
		
	After a call with the client's business partner, they've informed us that they prefer to receive the member
	data in comma-separated-value (CSV) file format. 
	
	They also want to receive only the eligible member's information in the output file. For this purpose, they've sent us
	a "EligibleMembers.txt" file which contains Member's ID, Effective from and Effective To dates. We need to generate 
	the output file only for the member they are listed in the "EligibleMembers.txt" file and whose membership is not terminated as of Today.
	
	They have the additional requirements on the output files as below:
		a) the member data file must be split by state. The split files must have state prefix ( eg : 'NY_outputFile.csv', 'MN_outputFile.csv')
		b) they will not accept a file that has duplicate member records in it.
		c) the fields should be in following order in the CSV file(s).
		
			[ id, first name, last name, address, city, zip ]


Task :
----
	- Write Main class and implement the remaining logic in other classes to perform the conversion described above.



Note:
----
	- Use the classes EligibilityImporterImpl,  MemberExporterImpl  and MemberImporterImpl to avoid code duplication. 
	- You are not allowed to modify the input files.
	- You are not allowed to add any additional class(except for utility functions).
	- You may use Internet resources as required.
